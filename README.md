# Grade-Calculator
The Grade Calculator is a C++ program that allows users to input student marks, total marks, and marks weightage for a given number of subjects. It then calculates the overall grade based on the provided data.

**Features:**

Input: The program prompts the user to enter the number of subjects, student marks, total marks, and marks weightage for each subject.

Calculation: Using the given data, the calculator calculates the total marks achieved and ensures that the total marks weightage is 100%.

Grade Assignment: The program assigns grades based on the percentage of total marks. The grading criteria are as follows:

85% or above: 'A'
70% or above but below 85%: 'B'
60% or above but below 70%: 'C'
50% or above but below 60%: 'D'
Below 50%: 'F'
**How to Use:**

Run the program.
Enter the number of subjects when prompted by the console.
For each subject, enter the student marks, total marks, and marks weightage.
The program will process the input and display the calculated overall grade.
**Note:**

The Grade Calculator assumes the user will input valid data, including non-negative marks, total marks, and marks weightage values.
If the entered data violates any criteria, the program will display "Invalid Data" as the output.
